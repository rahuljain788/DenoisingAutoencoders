# DenoisingAutoencoders

# Introduction
Denoising Autoencoders are neural network models that remove noise from corrupted or noisy data by learning to 
reconstruct the initial data from its noisy counterpart. We train the model to minimize the disparity between 
the original and reconstructed data. We can stack these autoencoders together to form deep networks, 
increasing their performance.

Additionally, tailor this architecture to handle a variety of data formats, including images, audio, and text. 
Additionally, customise the noise, such as including salt-and-pepper or Gaussian noise. 
As the DAE reconstructs the image, it effectively learns the input features, leading to enhanced extraction of 
latent representations. It is important to highlight that the Denoising Autoencoder reduces the likelihood of 
learning the identity function compared to a regular autoencoder.

Denoising autoencoders (DAEs) offer several advantages over traditional noise reduction techniques. They effectively avoid the problem of creating oversimplified images, and they compute quickly. Unlike traditional filtering methods, DAEs use an improved autoencoder approach that involves inserting noise into the input and reconstructing the output from the corrupted image.

This modification to the standard autoencoder approach prevents the DAE from copying input to output. Instead, DAEs need to remove noise from the input before extracting meaningful information.

In our specific DAE approach, we have used CNN due to its effectiveness in deducing and preserving spatial relationships within an image. Additionally, employing CNNs helps reduce dimensions and computational complexity, making it possible to use arbitrary-sized images as input.
